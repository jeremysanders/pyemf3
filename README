This is a forked version of pyemf with support for Python 3.3+. It
should also run under Python 2.6 and 2.7. Patches are welcome. It
would be nice to clean up the file layout.

ABSTRACT
========

pyemf is a pure python module that provides bindings for an ECMA-234
compliant vector graphics library.  ECMA-234 is the published
interface for the Windows GDI used in the Microsoft windows
environment and, more importantly, natively supported by the
OpenOffice suite of tools.

DOCUMENTATION
=============

The most current documentation is always available on the web at
$url/api/index.html

Or, in the source distribution, the directory website/api/ contains a
copy of the api documentation for version $version.  Simply point your
web browser at the index.html within that directory.



EXAMPLES
========

Creating an EMF
---------------

Here's a simple program (available as test-1.py in the distribution)
that connects opposite corners of an 8in by 6in rectangle with lines:

#!/usr/bin/env python

import pyemf

width=8
height=6
dpi=300

emf=pyemf.EMF(width,height,dpi)
thin=emf.CreatePen(pyemf.PS_SOLID,1,(0x01,0x02,0x03))
emf.SelectObject(thin)
emf.Polyline([(0,0),(width*dpi,height*dpi)])
emf.Polyline([(0,height*dpi),(width*dpi,0)])
emf.save("test-1.emf")


Examining an EMF
----------------

pyemf, when run as a standalone program, has the ability to read an
EMF and print out the contents.  Run:

$ pyemf.py -v test-1.emf

and it will print out a text summary of all the metafile records in
the file.


Other tests
-----------

There are many other tests included in the examples/ directory in the
source distribution.  After installing the pyemf library, you should
be able to run them like this:

$ cd examples
$ python test-drawing1.py

and examine the output file 'test-drawing1.emf' by loading it in
OpenOffice Impress.

Also included in the examples directory is the program
'test--run-all.py' that will run all the tests.
