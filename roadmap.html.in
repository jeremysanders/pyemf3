<h1>Version Numbers</h1>

<p>$prog follows the Python standard of version numbers for modules:
major.minor.patchlevel[subrelease].  From the <a
href="http://docs.python.org/dist/meta-data.html">distutils
docs</a>:</p>

<div class="cite">
The major number is 0 for initial, experimental releases of
software. It is incremented for releases that represent major
milestones in a package. The minor number is incremented when
important new features are added to the package. The patch number
increments when bug-fix releases are made. Additional trailing version
information is sometimes used to indicate sub-releases. These are
"a1,a2,...,aN" (for alpha releases, where functionality and API may
change), "b1,b2,...,bN" (for beta releases, which only fix bugs)
</div>

<P>Obviously, I'm not starting at major number 0.  See below.


<h1>History</h1>

<dl>
<dt>1.0.0 - <emph>Abandoned</emph></dt>
<dd>

<p>This was an almost-complete <a href="http://www.swig.org">SWIG</a>
wrapper around <a href="http://libemf.sourceforge.net">libEMF</a>.
But, it's harder to distribute a SWIG module that a pure python one,
and I also wanted to support a few more features than were available
in libEMF.</p>

</dd>



<dt>2.0.0 - <emph>Currently in development at version $version</emph></dt>
<dd>

<P>This is the current version.  I had to change major numbers because
the API changed from version 1.*.  At the time, I wasn't sure how long
it would take me to code up version 2.* and was thinking that I might
release version 1 in the interrim.</p>

<P>But, I was able to code up version 2.0.0b1 in a reasonable time,
but by then I was far enough along in my thinking that I just left the
version numbers alone.  A bit strange to release a version 2.* before
a 1.* became public, but given the amount of time I invested in
version 1.0.0 and debugging the SWIG interface, I at least want to
give a nod to myself for some good effort.</p>

</dd>

<dt>2.1.0 - <emph>Future plans</emph></dt>
<dd>

<P>Things I'd like to support:</p>

<ul>
<li>understand the viewport origin and extent commands</li>
<li>understand the window origin and extent commands</li>
</ul>

</dd>

<P>&nbsp;</p>


<dt>2.x.0 - <emph>Way future plans</emph></dt>
<dd>

<P>Somewhere off in the distance...</p>

<ul>
<li>Font metrics.   Maybe.</li>
</ul>

</dd>

<h1>Known Issues</h1>

<dl>
<dt>Window and Viewport extents are not well understoood</dt>
<dd>

<P>I'm still trying to understand the various permutations of units
set by SetMapMode and how they effect the viewport and window extents.
So, all the functions [Set|Get|Scale][Viewport|Window][Org|Ext]Ex
exist in pyemf, but they aren't guarenteed to do the right thing,
unless you the user happen to know what the right thing is.</p>

<P>I certainly don't know what the right thing is yet in all cases.  The
ECMA spec is unclear, and the Microsoft docs are fuzzy at best.</p>

</dd>

<dt>Bitmap functions don't exist</dt>
<dd>

<P>Since I wanted to support the vector graphics capabilities, bitmap
support wasn't a high priority to me.  Patches welcome, however.</p>

</dd>

<dt>Text metrics functions don't exist</dt>
<dd>

<P>A full GDI implementation would include font metrics such that fine
grained control over glyph placement is available.  To really do text
extents properly, a complete font metrics package would need to be
added.  This requires a module that could link to something like
freetype.  There is a freetype module included in matplotlib that I
may look at for some future release, and in fact for my matplotlib
modifications, I've used the freetype module with a bit of hackery to
be able to place text strings in relation to one another.</P>

<P>So, only the basics of font support are included.  It seems to be a
bit renderer dependent as to how the fonts will be chosen based on the
specifications to CreateFontA.  For example, what happens when you
request a font that isn't available on your target computer?  I
suppose this problem isn't limited to pyemf, but to any EMF that uses
fonts.</P>

<P>Comparing the output on PowerPoint vs OpenOffice Impress seems to show
that fonts render about the same, but in terms of precisely placing
strings of text in relation to other strings (e.g. knowing where a
string ends so you could append a string right after that), it seems
that we're a bit out of luck for the moment unless we can integrate it
with some external library for metrics.</P>

<P>I'm still needing to do more research before I add font extents to
pyemf.  If you're curious and want to figure out how this stuff works
in GDI, the prime suspect is the function GetTextExtentPoint32A(),
which should measure the width and height of a string.  But also of
interest are how CreateFont and CreateFontIndirect and how they
specify fonts.</P>
